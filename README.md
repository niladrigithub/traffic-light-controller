# Traffic Light Controller VHDL Project

![Traffic Light Controller](traffic_light_controller_image.png)

## Overview

This VHDL project implements a sophisticated Traffic Light Controller system using Xilinx Vivado for FPGA programming. The project includes a state-of-the-art state machine to manage various traffic scenarios, providing reliable and responsive control for traffic lights and pedestrian crossings.

## Features

- **Traffic Light Sequences:** Standard traffic light sequences, including STOP, READY, GO, and SLOWDOWN phases.
  
- **Pedestrian Crossing:** A responsive pedestrian crossing mechanism triggered by the pedestrian request signal.

- **Flexible Configuration:** Designed for flexibility, allowing easy adjustment of clock frequency and timing parameters to meet specific FPGA and application requirements.

## Usage
